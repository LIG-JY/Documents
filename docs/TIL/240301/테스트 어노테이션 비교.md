## @ContextConfiguration vs @SpringBootTest

### @ContextConfiguration

[@ContextConfiguration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-spring/annotation-contextconfiguration.html)

@ContextConfiguration defines class-level metadata that is used to determine how to load and configure an ApplicationContext `for integration tests`.

Specifically, @ContextConfiguration declares the application context `resource locations` or the component classes used to load the context.

### Spring context(application context)

The Spring context, or application context, is the central interface within a Spring application for providing `configuration information` to the application. It is responsible for `instantiating`, `configuring`, and `assembling` the beans. The context takes the form of an XML file, Java annotations, or Java code.

The Spring context loads the full application context as defined by your Spring configuration. It's used in the actual running application and can also be used in `integration tests` to load a real context.

### @SpringBootTest

@ContextConfiguration의 특별판 Aplication Context 전체를 load 함

@SpringBootTest is `a specialized version of @ContextConfiguration` for Spring Boot applications. It automatically searches for a @SpringBootApplication or @SpringBootConfiguration annotated class and uses that `to configure the test context`.

It loads the entire application context, including all configuration and components, making it suitable for integration tests where you want to test the application in a context that's close to production.

It also provides additional auto-configuration and can be used to run an actual server, making it ideal for more comprehensive integration tests.

### Test Context

The test context refers to the context configuration specifically designed for tests. It provides additional test-specific features such as test transactions, caching, and test-specific beans.

Test context setup can be lighter and more targeted, focusing only on the components necessary for the tests, which can speed up test execution.
